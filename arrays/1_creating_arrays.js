let myArray = [];

// I know that it looks weird, but it works! In this line, we are declaring a variable
// called "myArray" and initializing it to an empty array:

// When we say an array is empty, what we mean is that our array isn't storing any items
// There are severa ways to have array store items. One way is by creating our array with
// some items prepopulated. The way we do that is by specifying the items we want to create
// our array with inside the angle brackets:

let letters = ["a", "b", "c"];

// When this code runs, our letters array gets created with the letters a, b, and c already
// a part of its contents:

// Once we have created an array, the real part can begin! In the next section, we are going
// to look at some (possibly more!) common ways to add items into our array and balance it out
// with some ways to remove items as well.
