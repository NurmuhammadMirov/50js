<!-- I find it very interesting how when technology evolves we start
forgetting stuff. One of these things is the event delegation. Today,
when we pretty much always use a framework, the event bubbling and 
capturing is not a thing anymore. The tools that we rely on are handling
those processes. I remember how at interviews for front-end developer
positions this was one of the common questions. -->

<!-- Consider the following example: -->
<div id="container">
  <header>Hello</header>
  <button id="button">call to action</button>
</div>

<script>
  document
    .querySelector("button")
    .addEventListener("click", () => {});
</script>

<!-- When the page loads initially we attach a listener to the button
element. This works well unless we touch the DOM. As soon as we replace
the content of the container, we have to re-attach the listener. This may
seem a silly problem now, but it was a big thing a couple of years ago. -->

<!-- if we write vanilla JavaScript and have to manipulate the DOM elements,
we should make sure that our listeners are present. One of the solutions for
this iss to attach the listener to a parent element that doesn't change. In our
case this is <div id="container">. Then we rely on the event.target to find out
where the event comes from. -->

<script>
  document
    .querySelector("#container")
    .addEventListener('click', (event) => {
      // event.target....
    });
</script>

<!-- This works because of the event delegation. If not capture the event from
each element bubbles up and we are able to catch it. -->
