/* The first article about responsive design that I saw dates back to 2010. Ethan
Marcotte is its author. Since then, the Web evolved, and so have the developers that
are building websites. Nowadays, responsive architecture is not a question. It's the default. */

/* There are a couple of tools for implementing responsive design. Probably the main
one is media queries. It's a feature of CSS where we can specify a frame under which our
elements behave or/and look differently. For example: */

body {
  background-color: blue;
}

@media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
  body {
    background-color: red;
  }
}

/* The background color of the body is by default blue. However, if the
browser has a viewport width less than 800px the color becomes red. */

/* For a long time, this was only available in CSS. That is not the case anymore. */
/* we continued in 15_media_query_list.js */
