  <title>Call-to-action widgets script tag replacement</title>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Did you ever wonder how the call-to-action widgets work? You know, those
  little buttons for sharing content on social networks. Very often they are
  distributed as iframes, but sometimes we have to copy/paste script tags. And
  the instructions are "Place the following code where you want the button to
  appear". But if that is a script tag, how does it know where to inject the
  button? The goal of this chapter is to give you an answer to this question. -->
  <script src="./widget.js" data-color="#ff0000"></script>
  <section>
    Content here
  </section>
  <script src="./widget.js" data-color="#00ff00"></script>
  <!-- We want to see is a link followed by "Content here" followed by another
  link. Notice, that we not only want to replace those script tags. We want
  different results for each one of them. The color of the button should be
  different. -->
