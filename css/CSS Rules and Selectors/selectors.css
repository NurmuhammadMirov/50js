/* Basic Selectors Types */
/* 
    * Universal
    * Element
    * ID
    * Class
    * Attribute
*/

/* Removing all margins with the universal selector */
* {
    margin: 0;
}

/* ---------------Element Selector-------------- */
/* Applying a margin to all p elements */
p {
    margin: 25px;
}

/* ---------------ID Selector-------------- */
/* Applying padding to the element with an id of header */
#header {
    padding: 25px;
}

/* ---------------Class Selector-------------- */
/* Applying a color to all elements with the class nav-link */
.nav-link {
    color: darkcyan;
}

/* ---------------Attribute Selector-------------- */
/* 
    [name]
    Selects all elements that have the given attribute, regardless of its value 
*/

/* 
    [name="value"]
    Selects all elements that have the given attribute, whose value is the exaxt string value.
*/

/* 
    [name~="value"]
    Selects all elements that have the given attribute, whose value contains the string value
    separated by whitespace.

    Example:
    <div title="Hello World">Hello World</div>
    <div title="HelloWorld">HelloWorld</div>

    If you wrote a CSS rule with the selector [title~="World"], the first element would
    match but not the second. This is because in second element, the word "World" in the
    title attribute is not surrounded by whitespace.
*/

/* 
    [name*="value"]
    Selects all elements that have the given attribute, whose value contains the substring
    value. If we wrote another CSS rule, this time with the selector [title*="World"], it
    would match both elements. 
*/

/* 
    [name^="value"]
    Selects all elements that have the given attribute, whose value begins with value.
*/

/* 
    [name$="value"]
    Selects all elements that have the given attribute, whose value ends with value.
*/

/* ---------------Compound Selector-------------- */
/* 
    Any of the above selectors (except for the universal selector) can be used alone or
    in combination with other selectors to make the selector more specific. This is best
    illustrated with some examples:

    div.my-class
    Matches all div elements with a class of my-class

    span.class-one.class-two
    Matches all span elements with a class of both class-one and class-two

    a.nav-link[href*="example.com"]
    Matches all a elements with a class of nav-link that have an href attribute containing
    the string example.com
*/

/* ---------------Multiple Independent Selectors-------------- */
/* 
    A CSS rule can have multiple selectors separated by a comma. The rule will be applied
    to any element that is matched by any one of the given selectors:

    .class-one, .class-two
    Matches all elements with a class of class-one as well all elements with a 
    class of class-two.
*/

/* ---------------Descendant Combinator-------------- */
/* 
    The descendant combinator matches an element that is a descendant of the element on the
    left-hand side. Descendant means that the element exists somewhere within the child
    hierarchy - it does not have to be a direct child.
        The descendant combinator is specified with a space character.

        Example:
        .header div {
            color: green;
        }

        This selector matches all div elements that are direct or indirect descendants of any
        element with the class header. If these div elements contain additional div elements as
        children, those child div elements will also be matched by the selector.
*/

/* ---------------Child Combinator-------------- */
/* 
    The child combinator matches an element that is a direct child of the element on the left-hand
    side. It is specified with a > character.

    Example:
    .header > div {
        color: green;
    }
    
        The selector matches all div elements that are direct children of an element with the class
    header. If those div elements contain additional div elements as children, those div elements
    will not be matched by the selector (because they are descendants, not direct children).
*/

/* ---------------Subsequent Sibling Combinator-------------- */
/* 
    The subsequent sibling combinator matches an element that is a sibling, but not necessarily
    an immediate sibling, of the element on the left-hand side. It is specified with a ~ character.
    It only matches siblings going forward and does not match previous siblings.

    Example HTML elements:
    <div>
        <div class="intro"></div>
        <div class="article1"></div>
        <div class="article2"></div>
        <div class="summary"></div>
    </div>

    Example subsequent sibling combinator
    .article1 ~ div {
        background: skyblue;
    }
*/

/* ---------------Next Sibling Combinator-------------- */
/* 
    The next sibling combinator, specified with a + character, matches an elements's
    immediate next sibling only.

    Example
    .article1 + div {
        background: yellow;
    }

    Example a selector with multiple combinators
    header > div + button {
        background: gray;
    }
        This selector matches the button element inside the header. This works by first
    selecting the header's immediate child, the div, then selecting that element's next
    sibling, the button.
*/

/* ---------------Using Multiple Combinators-------------- */
/* 
    Just like basic selectors, combinators can be used together to form evem more specific
    selectors.

    Example HTML
    <div>
        <header>
            <div>Title</div>
            <button>Button</button>
        </header>
    </div>
*/
/* ---------------Pseudo-classes-------------- */
/* 
    A pseudo-class allows you to select elements based on some special state of the elements,
    in addition to all; the selectors discussed previously. Pseudo-classes start with a colon(:)
    character and can be used alone or combined with other selectors.
        Some pseudo-classes let you select elements based on interaction state (such as :focus or
        :hover), while others let you select elements based on their position in the document (such
        as :first-child)
*/

/* ---------------Interaction State-------------- */
/* 
    These pseudo-classes are based on some user interaction state:

    :active
    Matches an element that is currently being activated. For buttons and links, this usually
    means the mouse button has been pressed, but not yet released.

    :checked
    Matches a radio button, checkbox, or option inside a select element that is checked or selected.

    :focus
    Matches an element that currently has the input focus. This is typically used for buttons, links
    and text fields.

    :focus-within
    Similar to :focus but also matches an element that has a descendant element that is 
    currently focused.

    :hover
    Matches an element that the mouse cursor is currently hovering over. This is typically
    used fot buttons and links but can be applied to any type of element.

    :valid, :invalid
    Used with form elements using the HTML validation API. :valid matches an element which
    is currently valid according to validation rules, and :invalid matches an element which
    is not currently valid.

    :visited
    Matches a link whose URL has already been visited by the user. To protext a user's privacy,
    the browser limits what styling can be applied to an element matched by this pseudo-class.
